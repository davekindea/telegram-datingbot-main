This is a Python-based Telegram bot designed to help users match and meet new friends. The bot allows users to create profiles, search for potential matches, and interact with others. It uses MySQL to store user data and manage the matching process.

## Features
- User registration and profile creation
- Matching users based on preferences
- Facilitating interactions between matched users
- Payment link generation for premium features
- Inline keyboard and custom message handling

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.9 or higher
- A Telegram Bot Token (can be obtained via [BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#botfather))
- MySQL database setup
- The following Python libraries

## Required Libraries
Here are the required Python libraries used in the bot:

- `python-telegram-bot==20.7`
- `mysql-connector-python==8.3.0`
- `requests==2.31.0`
- `urllib3==2.0.10`
- `asyncio`
- Other necessary libraries can be found in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/telegram-datingbot.git
    cd telegram-datingbot
    ```

2. **Install required libraries:**

    It's recommended to install dependencies in a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Set up your database:**

    Make sure you have a MySQL database running. Update the database connection details in the bot code:

    ```python
    # Example MySQL connection setup in your code
    mysql.connector.connect(
        host="your-database-host",
        user="your-database-user",
        password="your-database-password",
        database="your-database-name"
    )
    ```

4. **Add your Telegram Bot Token:**

    Replace `"YOUR_TOKEN"` with your actual token in the bot configuration:

    ```python
    application = Application.builder().token("YOUR_TOKEN").build()
    ```

5. **Run the bot:**

    After everything is set up, run the bot with:

    ```bash
    python bot.py
    ```

## Usage
Once the bot is running, users can interact with the bot on Telegram by sending commands and messages.
